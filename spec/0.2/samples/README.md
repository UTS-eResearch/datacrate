# Datacrate samples

The [sample](./sample) directory has an example DataCrate - you can preview the [CATALOG.html file](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate/blob/master/spec/0.1/samples/sample/CATALOG.html). This is also published at the Zenodo repository with a DOI: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1009240.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1009240).
 
(There's a typo in the dataset, which points the development branch of the spec on github, will fix that with a new version at some point)

There are some other dataset which will become available soon.
